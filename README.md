# SoftwareTesting

In the previous assignment, we have created a test plan for an open-source JavaScript utility library, the library can be found from https://github.com/otula/COMP.SE.200-2021-2022-1. Source codes are available under /src. It also contains a hidden folder ./internals which is not part of the testing process and should be excluded from any plans, test reports and coverage reports. In this assignment, we will execute the testing process. The next step is to write tests and verify that they pass on local environment. After that, codes are pushed to GitHub and verify that they also pass in the Travis CI pipeline and show up correctly in Coveralls. Finally, all key findings will be reported in this document.
